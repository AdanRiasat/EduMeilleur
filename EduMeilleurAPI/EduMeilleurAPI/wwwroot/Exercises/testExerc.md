- a) How high up the wall does the ladder reach?
- b) How far is the base of the ladder from the wall?

# ✅ Answers

**Exercise 1:**

- a) Opposite = 10 × sin(30°) = 5 cm  
- b) Adjacent = 10 × cos(30°) ≈ 8.66 cm

---

**Exercise 2:**

- Triangle is isosceles. So:  
  - b = c  
  - Use sine rule or Pythagoras:  
    - b = c = 10 cm

---

**Exercise 3:**

b = (12 × sin(60°)) / sin(40°) ≈ 16.17 cm

---

**Exercise 4:**

z² = 8² + 6² - 2 × 8 × 6 × cos(60°) = 64 + 36 - 48 = 52  
z ≈ √52 ≈ 7.21 cm

---

**Exercise 5:**

- a) Height = 5 × sin(70°) ≈ 4.7 m  
- b) Distance from wall = 5 × cos(70°) ≈ 1.71 m
